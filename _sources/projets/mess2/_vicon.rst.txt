The ACE Lab at WPI houses a VICON motion capture system consisting of several VICON Valkyrie cameras that provide millimeter localization to a fleet of UAVs and UGVs. To use the pose data in real time, the system is integrated with ROS2 Humble using a modified version of [OPT4SMARTS' ros2-vicon-receiver](https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ros2-vicon-receiver).
